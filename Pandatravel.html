            <blockquote>"I was in The Cuban Club while looking for Ghosts on the Ybor City Ghost Tour. If haunted buildings and ghosts are your thing this place to just the bee's knees."</blockquote>
        
        <h4><i>Kody said..</i></h4>
            <blockquote>"This was the first ghost tour that my wife and I went on and it was a lot of fun. Our guide, Joe, really made the history of Ybor come alive. We actually went inside two haunted locations. However, for me, the Cuban Club was the most impressive. Even before we were given "ghost meters" to play with, I had a strong oppressive sensation in there. Its great to see another side of Ybor beside the night clubs and tattoo parlors."</blockquote>
        
        <h4><i>Leah said..</i></h4>
            <blockquote>"My friends and I try to go on a ghost tour for fun everywhere we visit and this was by FAR the BEST ever out of the dozens. The storytelling was superb and the places we visited had such eerie tales. The Cuban Dance Hall stood out for creepiness. Not only did we hear crazy tales, we got an in-depth history of Ybor! The Ybor sites were featured on one of the ghost shows on television because itâ€™s such a haunted place! So check it out!"</blockquote>
